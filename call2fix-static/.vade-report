# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Call2Fix static HTML website.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **index.html** - Added Vercel Web Analytics tracking scripts to the `<head>` section

## Implementation Details

Added the following analytics code to the HTML file:
```html
<!-- Vercel Web Analytics -->
<script>
  window.va = window.va || function () { (window.vaq = window.vaq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/insights/script.js"></script>
```

The scripts were inserted in the `<head>` section, after the existing manus debug collector script and before the closing `</head>` tag.

## Why This Approach?

For plain HTML sites, Vercel Web Analytics requires adding two script tags:
1. An initialization script that sets up the `window.va` function
2. A deferred script that loads the analytics tracking from `/_vercel/insights/script.js`

This implementation follows the official Vercel Web Analytics documentation for HTML sites.

## Next Steps

To enable analytics:
1. Deploy this updated site to Vercel
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project Settings → Analytics → Enable)
3. After deployment, analytics data will start being collected automatically
4. Verify by checking the Network tab in browser dev tools for requests to `/_vercel/insights/view`

## Notes

- No package installation was needed as this is a plain HTML site
- The analytics script is loaded with `defer` attribute for optimal performance
- Route tracking is not available for plain HTML implementations (only for framework-specific implementations)
- The implementation requires no changes to the existing JavaScript or CSS assets
